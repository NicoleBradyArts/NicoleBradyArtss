                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Nicole Brady is a multihyphenate theatre artist most known for her abstract concepts and fixation on psychology. She made her directorial debut at Point Park with her original work “I Love You, You Love Me”, a dance theatre experience which explores a day in the life of a lonely clown. Her writing explores deeply human themes in strange, unusual, sometimes terrifying ways. She has a one-minute play published in Fresh Words Magazine Special Horror Anthology, “SHHH! Breathe Slow”.</p>
                <p>While most of her work is quite dark, she is not shy to use comedy for the characters, audience, and most importantly herself to cope with tragedy. Recently, you may have seen her as The Goose in “In the Woods, Still I Hear Them” at the RLM One Acts festival, with the Evening Crane Theatre presenting The Seasons at the 2024 Pittsburgh Fringe Festival, or heard her on Play on Words Podcasts', “The Proposal”.</p>
                <p>Nicole is pursuing a BFA in Theatre Arts, additionally minoring in Costume Design and Psychology, respectively at Point Park University. Throughout her time there she found her niche in stage makeup, learned to love the art of puppetry, and rediscovered a passion for voiceover. She is a uniquely well-rounded artist, just don’t ask her to sing. </p>
        
                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>I strive to make and participate in work the recontextualizes the audience's world. You could dissect someone’s brain and still never truly know them; our minds are infinite and that is terrifying and beautiful. We can all learn to be a little more understanding of each other. </p>
